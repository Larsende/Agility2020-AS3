Lab 3 - Adding WAF policy to application
----------------------------------------

This lab will be broken down to 3 parts.

#. We will apply an already existing WAF policy to an HTTPS virtual server.
#. We will apply an policy that is stored in a source repository to an HTTPS virtual server.
#. We will update the policy to be in blocking mode.
